# createRenderEffect

`createRenderEffect` provides a way to handle effects that need to run during rendering.

## Usage

```tsx
import { createSignal, createRenderEffect } from 'solid-js';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  
  createRenderEffect(count, (c) => {
    document.title = `Count: ${c}`;
  });
  
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count()}</button>;
}
```

Similar to [`createEffect`](/reactivity/createEffect), `createRenderEffect` accepts two arguments:

1. A reactive function to track dependencies of the side effect and return a value.
2. A side effect function that will be called with the value returned from the reactive function.

There are some key differences between `createRenderEffect` and `createEffect`:

1. Every `createRenderEffect` will run before any `createEffect` runs.
2. If a `createRenderEffect` depends on an newly created async signal that is not resolved yet, it will trigger its parent [`<Suspense>`](/rendering/suspense) boundary.
3. If a `createRenderEffect` depends on an existing async signal that is not resolved yet, it will return with the previous value, similar to [`latest`](/reactivity/utilities#latest).
