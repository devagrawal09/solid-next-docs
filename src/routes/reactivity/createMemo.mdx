# createMemo

`createMemo` creates a derived signal that automatically updates when its dependencies change.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { createSignal, createMemo } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  const doubled = createMemo(() => count() * 2);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count()}, Doubled: {doubled()}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Lazy evaluation

Starting from solid 2.0 `createMemo` evaluates lazily (not synchronously as in version `^1.0`).
It means that if the memo value is not used, the memo function won't be executed:

```tsx
import { createMemo } from "solid-js";

/** Memo is not used */
function UnusedLazyMemoExample() {
  const unusedValue = createMemo(() => {
    console.log("This code is not running if the value is not used");

    return "Test value";
  });

  return <div>Memo is not executed</div>;
}
```

## Derived signals vs `createMemo`

Sometimes it's useful to use `createMemo` instead of **derived signals**: if you use derived signal, you subscribe to **all signals** which are used inside that derived signal. With `createMemo` you subscribe to **memo result** only.

```tsx
import { createSignal, createMemo, createEffect } from "solid-js";

function DerivedSignalVsMemoExample() {
  const [number1, setNumber1] = createSignal(0);
  const [number2, setNumber2] = createSignal(0);

  const derivedSum = () => number1() + number2();
  // By default memo compares old and new values with `===`
  const memoSum = createMemo(() => number1() + number2());

  // this `createEffect` is subscribed to one signal (from `createMemo`)
  createEffect(memoSum, (memoSum) => console.log(`Memo sum is logged only once: ${memoSum}`));

  // Even the sum of two numbers is always 0
  // This createEffect is subscribed to both signals instead of the result sum value
  createEffect(derivedSum, (derivedSum) =>
    console.log(`Derived sum is logged every time when you update numbers: ${derivedSum}`)
  );

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        // Make the sum always the same
        setNumber1((number1) => number1 + 1);
        setNumber2((number2) => number2 - 1);
      }}
    >
      Increase number1 and decrease number2
    </button>
  );
}
```
